## Overview
I have been awarded a scholarship from Misk Academy, to study this Nano-degree from Udacity.


During the past 4 months, this course helped me to advance my programming skills, I learned how to clean messy data, uncover patterns and insights, make predictions using machine learning, and clearly communicate findings. 



## Courses:
### 1. Introduction to Data Analysis
In this course, I learned about the data analysis process and practiced investigating different datasets using SQL and Python and its powerful packages for data analysis.

- [**Project 1: Explore Weather Trends**](https://github.com/wejdanalsharif/Data-Analyst-Nano-Degree-Program/blob/main/Explore_Weather_Trends_Project.pdf) In this project, I used basic SQL queries to download data from a database. Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

- [**Project 2: Investigate a Dataset**](https://github.com/wejdanalsharif/Data-Analyst-Nano-Degree-Program/tree/main/Investigate%20a%20Dataset) In this project I chose one of Udacity's curated datasets, performed an investigation, and share the findings.



### 2. Practical Statistics
In this course, I learned how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.
- [**Project 3: Analyze AB Test Results**](https://github.com/wejdanalsharif/Data-Analyst-Nano-Degree-Program/tree/main/Analyze%20AB%20Test%20Results) For this project, worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.



### 3. Data Wrangling
In this course, I learned to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.
Showcase the wrangling efforts through analyses and visualizations.
- [**Project 4: Wrangle and Analyze Data**](https://github.com/wejdanalsharif/Data-Analyst-Nano-Degree-Program/tree/main/Wrangle%20and%20Analyze%20Data) The goal for this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.



### 4. Data Visualization
In this course, I chose one of Udacity's curated datasets, and performed an exploratory data analysis using Python. Then created a presentation (slide-show) with explanatory plots that conveys the findings.
- [**Project 5: Communicate Data Findings**](https://github.com/wejdanalsharif/Data-Analyst-Nano-Degree-Program/tree/main/Communicate%20Data%20Findings) This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to explore the dataset. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships.



## Finally

This Nano-degree has helped me develop my programming and analytical skills, which is going to help me alot in my data career path.
