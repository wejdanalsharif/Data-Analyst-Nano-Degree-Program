# (Ford GoBike System Data)
## by (Wejdan Homoud Al Ali)


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

> I noticed that most of the users are subscribers with 158337 counts, and not customers (16561).

> There was nothing noticable in the relationship between Birth Year and Genders, but after adding a third variable (User Type) we can see that the average between the two types for males and females is close to each other, while in (gender = other) subscribers are higher than customers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The most interesting thing is that most of users are subscribers and most of them are males born between 80's & 90's.
