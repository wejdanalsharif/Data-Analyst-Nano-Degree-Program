# Data-Analyst-Nano-Degree-Program


### Overview
I have been awarded a scholarship from Misk Academy, to study this Nano-degree from Udacity.


During the past 4 months, this course helped me to advance my programming skills, I learned how to clean messy data, uncover patterns and insights, make predictions using machine learning, and clearly communicate findings.
